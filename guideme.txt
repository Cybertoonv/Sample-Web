### JAVASCRIPT GUIDANCE:

To tell you the truth its a mess;
but i am a nice guy so just for you create variables which you can change to change the colors of bullets tags and etc 
but even if you still have trouble with my defaults go change them from the script after searching
Color effect : Remember they only support ANSI color if you find more just create the darn variables
